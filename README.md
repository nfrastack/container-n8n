## Installation

### Prebuilt Images
Feature limited builds of the image are available on the [Github Container Registry](https://github.com/nfrastack/container-n8n/pkgs/container/container-n8n) and [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nfrastack/n8n).

To unlock advanced features, one must provide a code to be able to change specific environment variables from defaults. Support the development to gain access to a code.

To get access to the image use your container orchestrator to pull from the following locations:

```
ghcr.io/nfrastack/container-n8n:(image_tag)
docker.io/nfrastack/n8n:(image_tag)
```

Image tag syntax is:

`<image>:<optional tag>-<optional_distribution>_<optional_distribution_variant>`

Example:

`ghcr.io/nfrastack/container-n8n:latest` or

`ghcr.io/nfrastack/container-n8n:1.0` or

`ghcr.io/nfrastack/container-n8n:1.0-alpine` or

`ghcr.io/nfrastack/container-n8n:alpine`

* `latest` will be the most recent commit
* An otpional `tag` may exist that matches the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) - These are the safest
* If it is built for multiple distributions there may exist a value of `alpine` or `debian`
* If there are multiple distribution variations it may include a version - see the registry for availability

Have a look at the container registries and see what tags are available.

#### Multi-Architecture Support

Images are built for `amd64` by default, with optional support for `arm64` and other architectures.

### Quick Start

* The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See the examples folder for a working [compose.yml](examples/compose.yml) that can be modified for your use.

* Map [persistent storage](#persistent-storage) for access to configuration and data files for backup.
* Set various [environment variables](#environment-variables) to understand the capabilities of this image.

### Persistent Storage

The following directories are used for configuration and can be mapped for persistent storage.

| Directory | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |

### Environment Variables

#### Base Images used

This image relies on a customized base image in order to work.

| [OS Base](https://github.com/nfrastack/container-base/) | Base Image  |

Below is the complete list of available options that can be used to customize your installation.

* Variables showing an 'x' under the `Advanced` column can only be set if the containers advanced functionality is enabled.
